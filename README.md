# Shopping-Cart-for-any-Dynamic-Ecomerce

Dynamic E-commerce Shopping Cart Project
This project is a React-based mini e-commerce shopping cart application. It allows users to select items, add them to the cart, and proceed to the payment options. It serves as a practical exercise for building and understanding the mechanics of a dynamic shopping cart within an e-commerce context.

Features
Item Selection: Users can browse through a list of available items and select the ones they want to purchase.

Adding to Cart: Selected items can be added to the shopping cart, which dynamically updates the cart summary.

Cart Display: The shopping cart is displayed with details of the selected items, including names, quantities, and total prices.

Payment Options: Users can proceed to the payment options but cannot make an actual payment. This feature is for practice purposes.

Technologies Used
React: The project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

State Management: State management in the application is handled using React's built-in state and props.
